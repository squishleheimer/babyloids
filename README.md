# Babyloids

Kick off your project with this Babylon.js minimum scene boilerplate. This is built on top of [Gatsby's default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) and everything that is included there is also here.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Create a Gatsby-Babylonjs site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new babyloids https://github.com/creationspirit/gatsby-babylonjs-starter
    ```

1. **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd babyloids/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `babyloids` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/scene.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
